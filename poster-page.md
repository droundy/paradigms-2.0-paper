## Institutional change research

[Emily van Zee has been studying the change process.](http://physics.oregonstate.edu/portfolioswiki/toolkit:start)

### Why reform the Paradigms?

1. Community college transfer students

    * Behind by a few courses when transferring.
    * Must be able to finish Physics major in two years.
    * Want to reduce extra courseload Fall of junior year.

2. 4-year students

    * Challenging transition to upper-division in junior year.

3. Coupled curricular changes

    * Changes in major that could not be made in isolation.

4. New faculty

    * The Paradigms' success came from faculty buy-in.
    * Newer faculty lack an understanding of the curriculum.

### How to develop consensus?

1. Information gathering

    * Survey of faculty and students
    * Interviews of faculty teaching existing courses.
    * Index cards describing concepts and subjects taught.

2. Card sorting

    * Established dependency relationships between cards.
    * Sorted concepts and subjects into courses.
    * This resulted in a proposal for a revised set of courses.

3. Discussion with faculty

    * One-on-one meetings with faculty presenting courses.
    * This resulted in several revisions.
    * One faculty meeting to present the final proposal.
    * Hallways discussions over one week.
    * Faculty meeting to discuss and vote on the proposal.
    * Consensus!

## Changes made

1. *Physics of Contemporary Challenges*

    * Replaces *Modern Physics*, but taken earlier.
    * Focuses on "real-world" topics important to society.
    * Teaches estimation and conceptual reasoning skills.

2. *Techniques of Theoretical Mechanics*

    * Replaces senior-level classical mechanics, but earlier.
    * Teaches mathematical reasoning and sense-making.

3. 5-week Paradigms

    * Previously our junior-year courses were 3 weeks long.
    * Maintained 7 hour/week daily schedule.
    * Three 2-credit courses ‚ü∂ Two 3-credit courses.

4. *Math Methods* becomes "*Math Bits*"

    * Formal course replaced with just-in-time math.

5. *Computational Laboratory*

    * Require our 1-credit computational lab.

6. Less *Electronics* required

    * From 6 credits to 3 credits of electronics required.

7. More electives

    * From 3 credits to 6 credits of upper-division electives.

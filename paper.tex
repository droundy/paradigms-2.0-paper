% Last modified: 3/22/17: Add clarifying note about why the template has too much space around its section headers.
% 
% Changelog
% 3/14/17: add 2-column figure example, tweak text to align with Word sample file, add hyperref for links/cross-references
% 6/21/16: 	Fix old PACS option and superscript affiliations.
% 5/5/16: 	Update sample table to use the REVTEX ruledtabular environment for auto-sizing;
%   		switch to using pra option until the prstper style is fixed (who knows when).
% 5/10/16: Swap suggested department/institution ordering in \affiliation lines.
% 5/12/16: Remove PACS line (deprecated).
% 6/21/16:	Switch to noshowpacs and add superscriptaddress in documentclass options.
% 
% This is my best effort to follow the Physical Review style guide plus specific changes 
% required for PERC (mostly, omitting article titles in references). This version compiles 
% with pdfLaTeX alone; using a proper .bib file changes the bibliography part at the end 
% and would require running BibTex as well.
%
% Finally, there's extra padding around section headers if you compile the bare template. 
% I believe that's because LaTeX stretches its white space to keep the floats (tables and 
% figures) near their input locations. The excess spacing goes away when a normal amount 
% of body text is filled in.

% Big list of reference documentation is here: http://journals.aps.org/revtex, 
%  see especially the APS Author Guide PDF link.

% Notes on the revtex4-1 documentclass options used: 
%  reprint does the double-column, publication ready appearance
%  prstper style formats reference numbers incorrectly, fast fix is to use pra instead.
%  Add longbibliography option to show article titles (and see note in bibliography)

%\documentclass[english,aps,prstper,reprint,showpacs]{revtex4-1}   % This version should work (prstper option), but actually formats reference numbers incorrectly.
\documentclass[english,aps,pra,reprint,noshowpacs,superscriptaddress]{revtex4-1}   
% Using pra instead of prstper gives correct square-bracket (not superscript) reference formatting
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}	% should generally be included for better accented-word behavior

\begin{abstract}
In 2016, the Department of Physics at Oregon State University began a
process to revise our Paradigms in Physics curriculum for physics
majors.  This poster will describe both the process by which our
department achieved consensus on this curricular change, and the
resulting curriculum.  The Paradigms 2.0 committee begain with a
survey of students and faculty, followed by individual interviews with
the faculty teaching each existing course.  As we developed a plan to
address student- and faculty-identified challenges in the curriculum,
we met with each faculty member individually to explain and refine our
proposal, which was unanimously approved by the faculty.  Major
changes include elimination or major changes to several courses (math
methods, computational physics, modern physics, electronics, and
classical mechanics), including the introduction of two sophomore-year
courses designed specifically to help prepare students to for their
upper-division courses.

\section{Introduction}
The Paradigms in Physics program

\subsection{Background}
\emph{What is the Paradigms now?}
\subsection{History of the Paradigms}
\emph{How did we get here?~\cite{manogue2001paradigms}}
\subsection{Motivation for the change}
\paragraph{Curricular changes}
There were a number of factors that motivated us to embark on the
Paradigms~2.0 process.  The original Paradigms in Physics curricular
reform from 200? was showing its age.  In the intervening years we had
made a large number of modifications, such as reordering Paradigms,
introducing one new Paradigm, and introducing and changing
computational physics courses.  However, there were other changes
needed that could not be separated from an examination of the
curriculum as a whole.  Most notable were discussions of the
requirements for computational physics, the amount of required
electronics credits, and the role of our modern physics course.  These
persistent issues were not easily addressed without addressing the
physics major curriculum as a whole.

\paragraph{New faculty}
At this stage, (XX) of our faculty was not present during the orignal
Paradigms effort.  Many of the newer faculty have only a superficial
undertanding of our course structure.  This poses a challenge when
these professors teach courses that are closely intertwined with one
another.

% Last modified: 3/22/17: Add clarifying note about why the template has too much space around its section headers.
% 
% Changelog
% 3/14/17: add 2-column figure example, tweak text to align with Word sample file, add hyperref for links/cross-references
% 6/21/16: 	Fix old PACS option and superscript affiliations.
% 5/5/16: 	Update sample table to use the REVTEX ruledtabular environment for auto-sizing;
%   		switch to using pra option until the prstper style is fixed (who knows when).
% 5/10/16: Swap suggested department/institution ordering in \affiliation lines.
% 5/12/16: Remove PACS line (deprecated).
% 6/21/16:	Switch to noshowpacs and add superscriptaddress in documentclass options.

% This is my best effort to follow the Physical Review style guide plus specific changes 
% required for PERC (mostly, omitting article titles in references). This version compiles 
% with pdfLaTeX alone; using a proper .bib file changes the bibliography part at the end 
% and would require running BibTex as well.
%
% Finally, there's extra padding around section headers if you compile the bare template. 
% I believe that's because LaTeX stretches its white space to keep the floats (tables and 
% figures) near their input locations. The excess spacing goes away when a normal amount 
% of body text is filled in.

% Big list of reference documentation is here: http://journals.aps.org/revtex, 
%  see especially the APS Author Guide PDF link.

% Notes on the revtex4-1 documentclass options used: 
%  reprint does the double-column, publication ready appearance
%  prstper style formats reference numbers incorrectly, fast fix is to use pra instead.
%  Add longbibliography option to show article titles (and see note in bibliography)

\begin{abstract}
In 2016, the Department of Physics at Oregon State University began a
process to revise our Paradigms in Physics curriculum for physics
majors.  This poster will describe both the process by which our
department achieved consensus on this curricular change, and the
resulting curriculum.  The Paradigms 2.0 committee begain with a
survey of students and faculty, followed by individual interviews with
the faculty teaching each existing course.  As we developed a plan to
address student- and faculty-identified challenges in the curriculum,
we met with each faculty member individually to explain and refine our
proposal, which was unanimously approved by the faculty.  Major
changes include elimination or major changes to several courses (math
methods, computational physics, modern physics, electronics, and
classical mechanics), including the introduction of two sophomore-year
courses designed specifically to help prepare students to for their
upper-division courses.

\section{Introduction}
The introduction should clearly explain the nature and scope of the research as well as provide the reader with a roadmap of the rest of the paper.
	
Times New Roman 10 point font is used throughout the paper with single line spacing and the text is fully justified.  Paragraph style: indent first line three spaces (0.19''); there is no extra line spacing between paragraphs.  This is the standard font and layout for the individual paragraphs. % REVTeX with the options above handles this automatically.

The paper size is 8.5 $\times$ 11 inches.  Margins are 1'' top and bottom, 0.75'' left and right.  Each column is 3.35'' with 0.3'' spacing between them.  

Please do not adjust the spacing of the headers.  They should have a 12pt space before and a 6pt space after each heading. (Note: \LaTeX sets the white space itself, and sometimes pads section headers. This is most likely to happen in documents that are underfilled with text---like this template---and most of those problems resolve themselves as the paper reaches a normal length.)

Information about the style of paper and answers to other submission questions can be found on the PER--Central website~\cite{per-cent}. % Official style for references is to put them inside any following punctuation, with a space between the word and the bracketed reference number. Using a ~ as in the example here inserts a non-line-breaking space.


\section{Tables and Figures}

Figures, tables, and equations must be inserted in the text and may not be grouped at the end of the paper. Important: miscounting of figures, tables, or equations may result from revisions. Please double check the numbering of these elements before you submit your paper to the volume editor.  % LaTeX handles this automatically via the \label and \ref commands.

\subsection{Figures}

If your manuscript contains figures, they are typically placed in one column (see Fig.\ \ref{fig1}).  A large figure might span two columns (see Fig.\ \ref{fig2}).  Cite all figures in the text consecutively. The word ``Figure'' should be spelled out if it is the first word of the sentence and abbreviated as ``Fig.'' elsewhere in the text. Place the figures as close as possible to their first mention in the text at the top or bottom of the page.

\begin{figure}
%\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figure1}
\caption{Figure captions appear below the figure while table captions appear above the table.\label{fig1}}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Color figures}
Beginning in 2013, color figures are allowable since the PERC Proceedings will be available only in an online format.  However, authors are encouraged to check that the figures print in black and white without loss of clarity.

% Note: Revtex puts two-column figures at the top of a page. If you really need 
% to change this, gird yourself for battle and see http://tinyurl.com/j2wnoxb.
\begin{figure*}
%\includegraphics{figure2}
\caption{A 2-column figure. Center figure captions if they run one line only, and justify captions if they are multi-line.\label{fig2}}
\end{figure*}


\subsection{Tables}
Give each table a concise title and define any abbreviations in footnotes to the table. Place tables at the top or bottom of the page, close to where they are first cited (like Table \ref{tab1}). Center the table in the width of the text area, and center the caption as well.

Tables should not break across the page or column, but rather should be together cohesively.  In some cases, that may mean that a small amount of white space appears near the bottom of a column.

% REVTeX provides a ruledtabular environment that automatically sizes tables, adds double 
% lines, and adjusts column spacing. Use it around the regular tabular environment.
% For a two-column table, use \begin{table*} instead (with matching \end{table*}.
\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{This is a sample table.\label{tab1}}
\begin{ruledtabular}
\begin{tabular}{cl}
 & \textbf{MS Word} \\ 
 & \textbf{US Letter Size Paper} \\ 
 \hline
Primary Heading & Roman numerals, all capital letters \\
First subheading & Capital letters, only first \\
 & letter of first word capitalized \\
Second subheading & Numbers, italicized 
\end{tabular}
\end{ruledtabular}
\end{table}

\begin{abstract}
In 2016, the Department of Physics at Oregon State University began a
process to revise our Paradigms in Physics curriculum for physics
majors.  This poster will describe both the process by which our
department achieved consensus on this curricular change, and the
resulting curriculum.  The Paradigms 2.0 committee begain with a
survey of students and faculty, followed by individual interviews with
the faculty teaching each existing course.  As we developed a plan to
address student- and faculty-identified challenges in the curriculum,
we met with each faculty member individually to explain and refine our
proposal, which was unanimously approved by the faculty.  Major
changes include elimination or major changes to several courses (math
methods, computational physics, modern physics, electronics, and
classical mechanics), including the introduction of two sophomore-year
courses designed specifically to help prepare students to for their
upper-division courses.

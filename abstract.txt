Paradigms 2.0

David Roundy, Liz Gire, Ethan Minot, Emily van Zee, and Corinne A. Manogue

In 2016, the Department of Physics at Oregon State University began a
process to revise our Paradigms in Physics curriculum for physics
majors.  This poster will describe both the process by which our
department achieved consensus on this curricular change, and the
resulting curriculum.

The Paradigms 2.0 committee begain with a survey of students and
faculty, followed by individual interviews with the faculty teaching
each existing course to establish what was currently being taught.  We
then brainstormed with the faculty regarding ways that we could
improve on student- and faculty-identified challenges in the
curriculum.  After developing a specific proposal, we brought in each
faculty member individually to talk through the new curriculum and get
feedback.  After revision, we presented the curriculum plan to the
faculty as a whole, who voted unanimously to implement it.

Major changes include the elimination of several courses, the addition
of two sophomore-year courses to better prepare students to for their
junior-year Paradigms,
